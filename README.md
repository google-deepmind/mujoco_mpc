**MuJoCo MPC (MJPC)** is an interactive application and software framework for real-time predictive control with [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/), developed by DeepMind.

MJPC allows the user to easily author and solve complex robotics tasks, and currently supports three shooting-based planners: derivative-based iLQG and Gradient Descent, and a simple yet very competitive derivative-free method called Predictive Sampling.

For a detailed dive of the graphical user interface, see the [MJPC GUI](docs/GUI.md) documentation.

## Installation

You will need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and a working C++20 compiler to build MJPC. We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and 2 of its extensions ([CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) and [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)) to simplify the build process. 

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc.git`
2. Configure the project with CMake (a pop-up should appear in VSCode)
3. Build and run the `mjpc` target in "release" mode (VSCode defaults to "debug"). This will open and run the graphical user interface.

### macOS 
Additionally, install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Ubuntu 
Additionally, install:
```shell
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev ninja-build
```

### Build Issues 
If you encounter build issues, please see the [Github Actions](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc/.github/workflows/build.yaml). Note, we are using `clang-14`.

## Known Issues

MJPC is not production-quality software, it is a **research prototype**. There are likely to be missing features and outright bugs. If you find any, please report them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc/issues). Below we list some known issues, including items that we are actively working on.

- We have not tested MJPC on Windows, but there should be no issues in principle.
- Task specification, in particular the setting of norms and their parameters in XML, is a bit clunky. We are still iterating on the design.
- The Gradient Descent search step is proportional to the scale of the cost function and requires per-task tuning in order to work well. This is not a bug but a property of vanilla gradient descent. It might be possible to ameliorate this with some sort of gradient normalisation, but we have not investigated this thoroughly.
