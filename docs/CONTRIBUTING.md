# Contributing to MuJoCo MPC

We want MuJoCo MPC to be a true community-driven effort that continuously
improves and grows over time for the benefit of the entire research community.
As such, we welcome contributions such as:

- Adding new optimizers and estimators
- Adding new tasks and models

Note that MJPC follows [Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## How to contribute

Whether you want to fix an existing issue or work on adding new tasks and
models, please get in touch with us first (ideally _before_ starting work if
it's something major) by opening a new
[issue](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_mpc/issues). Coordinating up
front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

Once we reach an agreement on the proposed change, please submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_mpc/pulls) (PR) so that
we can review your implementation.

## Code Style

This code adheres to the [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).

- Include the standard copyright and license at the top of each file.
- The VSCode extension 'Clang-Format' can be used to format the C/C++ code to Google style.
- The package [cpplint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint) should be used to check for additional C/C++ style issues. Note: includes should follow the ordering found throughout MuJoCo MPC for consistency.
- The package [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink) can be used to format Python code. Please use: `--pyink-indentation 2 --line-length 80`.

## New Tasks

When submitting a PR for a new task using models from [MuJoCo Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie), do not include assets directly. Instead, modify the task [CMakeLists](mjpc/tasks/CMakeLists.txt) to copy these assets to the build binary.

## Unit Tests

Before submitting your PR, you can test your change locally by invoking ctest:

```
cd build/mjpc/test
ctest --output-on-failure .
```

This same test will run on GitHub CI once you open your PR.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
